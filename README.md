# Scientific Computing with Python

This repository contains my solutions for the projects completed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/). 

According to freeCodeCamp, "The Scientific Computing with Python (Beta) curriculum will equip you with the skills to analyze and manipulate data using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language. You'll learn key concepts like data structures, algorithm, Object Oriented Programming, and how to perform complex calculations using a variety of tools."

## Projects List

Here are the individual projects from the course that you can find in this repository:

1. **Arithmetic Formatter**  
   A project where you format arithmetic expressions in a readable way, taking inputs and ensuring the layout is aligned correctly.

2. **Time Calculator**  
   A program to calculate the difference between two times, including edge cases such as days, weeks, and time zones.

3. **Budget App**  
   A simple budget calculator that tracks and categorizes expenses and income.

4. **Polygon Area Calculator**  
   An application that calculates the area of various polygons (triangles, rectangles, etc.) using Python classes and methods.

5. **Probability Calculator**  
  This project implements a probability calculator that simulates drawing balls from a hat and calculates the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls.
